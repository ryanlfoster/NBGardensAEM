        jcr:description="Weston, good call on giving in to your wife and using poles. I had a similar experience a few years ago, and now I don’t go on a hike without them. Sometimes I will just have them with me and not actually use them, but they are always good to have around. It sounds like you aren’t one to hike with a daypack, but I have a pack with a place to strap my poles on the outside, so it’s not an inconvenience at all."
