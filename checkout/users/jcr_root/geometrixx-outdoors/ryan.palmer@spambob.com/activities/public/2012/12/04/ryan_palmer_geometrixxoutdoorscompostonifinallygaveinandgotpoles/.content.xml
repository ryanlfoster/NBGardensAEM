        jcr:description="Weston, I did s lot of research on this. For those who would like to know, a very exhaustive study found that hiking (or trekking) poles reduce stress on lower joints by as much as 25%, help extend muscle endurance, and decrease soreness the next day. Needless to say, I never hike without mine."
